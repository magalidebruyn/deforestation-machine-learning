# Analyzing deforestation with machine learning

How might we leverage machine learning to protect our forests? Through this project, I seek to analyze direct drives of deforestation from satellite imagery. I use deep learning and develop a convolutional neural network to classify images according to land use conversion of the felled forests. The development of the model is based on Stanford's ForestNet (Irvin et al., 2020).
