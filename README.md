# Analyzing deforestation with machine learning

How might we leverage machine learning to protect our forests? Through this project, I seek to analyze direct drives of deforestation from satellite imagery. I use deep learning and develop a convolutional neural network to classify images according to land use conversion of the felled forests. The development of the model is based on Stanford ML Group's ForestNet work (Irvin et al., 2020). By trying to replicate results from their paper, I hope to learn more about developing machine learning models, building neural networks, and practically applying these to monitor deforestation.
