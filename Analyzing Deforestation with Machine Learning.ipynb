    "# Problem definition\n",
    " \n",
    "Every 6 seconds in 2019, we lost one entire football field of primary rainforest (Weisse & Goldman, 2020). The destruction of forests is one of the most pressing and irreversibly impactful issues of our time. It is intrinsically tied to climate change, home and habitat loss, and income inequality (FAO & UNEP, 2020). Deforestation releases nearly 10% of all human greenhouse gas emissions (Rainforest Alliance, 2018). Yet, we have already cut almost half of all trees available and doubled our rate of deforestation in the past 15 years (Nunez, 2019). Despite all of our technological advancements, trees remain one of the most effective solutions for removing CO2, a main culprit of climate change, from the atmosphere (Bastin, 2020). We need to protect the world’s largest terrestrial carbon sink now (WWF, n.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncovering the land uses replacing forests can help us tackle this issue. With knowledge of the direct drivers of deforestation, decision-makers and stakeholders can develop and implement more effective policies and take more targeted action to curb forest loss (Irvin et al., 2020). "

    "# Solution specification\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual tracking and on-the-ground reporting of direct drivers, whilst accurate, is not scalable given the widespreadness of deforestation. Analysis of satellite imagery through machine learning (ML) models can therefore help us monitor forest loss at scale. ML techniques like decision-tree modeling, however, are limited for this application; they depend on high-resolution data that is not widely available and do not make full use of the information (e.g. multiple land uses) present in satellite images (Irvin et al., 2020). Convolutional neural networks, a semantic segmentation approach, and transfer learning can fill in that gap. \n",
    "\n",
    "Framed under this deep learning approach, the problem we are seeking to solve now takes the shape of a classification task. The developed model will classify each image containing forest loss as one of the four land use categories: \"plantation,\" \"smallholder agriculture,\" \"grassland/shrubland,\" and \"other.\" Through this, we can identify the direct driver of deforestation in a region (Irvin et al., 2020)."

The addition of SDA, PT, and Aux, whilst they do also contribute (though less significantly) to improving accuracy and f-scores, are beyond the scope of the current project. The largest improvements in their model performance metrics occur between the RF and CNN models and hence my focus on the latter."

    "ForestNet, the CNN model with the same architecture and backbone as specified above but with the addition of scene data augmentation, pre-training, and multi-modal fusion with auxiliary variables, achieved \"high classification performance\" on the test set across the four direct driver classes (Irvin et al., 2020). Whilst the authors do not include specifications on each driver category for the pure CNN model, the overall (all categories combined) accuracy and F1 scores for all the models are described.  \n",
    "            \n",
    "The F1 scores obtained in Irvin et al's (2020) CNN model is of 0.75 on the validation set and of 0.70 on the test set. In the model developed here, the F1 score is ______ on the validation set and ______ on the test set. The difference in scores might be due to a difference in (a) reporting calculations, (b) the loss function specifications, and/or (c) hyperparameter tuning. Irvin et al. (2020) report using the average of 10 runs for validation results, and the best validation run for test results. What this means in practice is unclear and might differ from the implementation here. The current version of Irvin et al.'s (2020) paper does not go into enough detail on what their \"linear combination of segmentation and classification losses\" looks like, to effectively replicate it. Access to their code in the future will be useful to understand better what parameters, including the loss function, they used to build their model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In our model, the highest F1 score is obtained for the plantation driver category, like for Irvin et al.'s (2020) more complex model. This might be attributable to the fact that this driver class compromises about 40% of both the training data and the test data. The smallholder agriculture category holds the second highest F1 score, followed by the \"other\" category. Last is the grassland/shrubland category. This might be due to confusion with smallholder agriculture: the precision rate of smallholder agriculture is prioritized at the expense of the precision rate of the grassland/shrubland (see Table 2 in Irvin et al. (2020) for evidence of this). This tradeoff can make sense because it is valuable to identify all cases of agriculture fueling deforestation over logging and empty land that can possibly regrow naturally. If, however, we instead instead wanted to prioritize accurately recognizing _all_ the cases of shrubland or minimize false positives (or, generally, obtain a better F1 score) for the grassland/shrubland deforestation driver, we might want to adjust the training procedure. Specifically, when evaluating the model on the validation set after each epoch, we may wish to save the checkpoint with the highest F1 score for the specific category of concern (in this case, grassland/shrubland), instead of for the mean across all four categories.\n",
